.. SerialComms.function::  getSerialInput(){

      This function reads the data from the serial
      connection and returns it as a string.

      This is used later to update the values

.. SerialComms.function:: getSepIndex(String input, char separator)

      Returns the index of the separator character
      in a string.


.. SerialComms.function:: UpdateGlobals(String input)

    This is a big ugly function which compares the
    input string to the names of variables that I have
    stored in memory; This is very much not the `C`
    way to do things...

    I think this could be a hash table. I haven't
    learned enough about hash table implementation
    yet and I know this works, so for the moment:
    *If it ain't broke*...
