   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to behaviour_box's documentation!
=========================================

``Version 3.0.20170201.8``

`Source Repository`_. 
.. _`Source Repository`: <https://github.com/palmerlab/behaviour_box>

This repository contains a set of files to implement a Go-No-Go task
using an Arduino and Python 2.7. By itself this collects some summary
information for a behavioural trial, but is not a stand alone
implementation. In addition to what is recorded here, I record the
signal direct from the lick sensor using
`Wavesurfer <https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/Wavesurfer>`__.

The two components to this implementation are the Arduino code, found in
``./behaviourbox/behaviourbox.ino`` and a Python wrapper for
communicating with this code ``./SerialControl.py``.

Note: *The python wrapper is not written in a cross platform way, it
relies on specific bindings for windows keyboard events.*

The behaviour box program is now split into a handful of modules. Each
module is mostly holding utility functions for the box as a whole. The
``behaviourbox.ino`` itself only contains ``setup`` and ``loop``
functions, which call the other components as necessary.
